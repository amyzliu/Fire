The purpose of Fire is to create a platform for mobile university students to connect with other students in the area they will be in during a certain semester. We plan to implement Nuance API for speech detection and Clarifai API for image recognition. The Fire App will be published on AppDirect's marketplace. This will be Fire. # Fire
